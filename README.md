🎓 College Admission Agent (RAG-based)
An AI-powered admission assistant that provides instant, accurate, and context-aware responses to student queries related to eligibility, courses, fees, deadlines, and application guidance.
Built using IBM Watsonx.ai, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and IBM Granite, it reduces manual inquiries and enhances the overall admission experience.


🧩 Problem Statement
The college admission process often involves repetitive queries from prospective students about eligibility criteria, available courses, fee structures, and important deadlines.
Manual handling via calls, emails, or in-person visits causes delays, extra workload, and poor applicant experience.
A smart, automated, and AI-driven solution is needed to streamline admissions and provide instant support.

💡 Proposed Solution
The College Admission Agent uses RAG with IBM Granite to:

Retrieve and summarize admission FAQs, eligibility, and fee structures from official sources.

Respond to natural language queries like:
“What is the last date for B.Tech admission?” or
“What is the eligibility for MBA?”

Provide real-time, concise, and accurate guidance via a web/chatbot interface deployed on IBM Cloud Lite.
